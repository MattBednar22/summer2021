## Tasks:

-Today's Non-Technical Tasks
1. Check the schedule of TMS
2. Set up Raspberry Pi and sensors for checking
3. Discussion with Sean, Wolfgang, and Joe about filtered data in the SDR (finally figured out!)
   (Feedback: In the cloud case, we only have the HTTP/JSON API. Because we can filter data using the API, we can still do something similar to subscribing to only specific kind of data.)
   So, in current progress, MQTT is not required. (might be future plan)
   

-Today's Technical Tasks
1. Use HTTP request to get data from a REST endpoint on Node-RED (External REST API  - https://restcountries.eu) - Success!!
2. Read the doc of REST API more. (Also check other relevant video as well)

-Things to do
1. Test the HTTP request again with SDR.
  1) Read example query data from SDR using HTTP / JSON request. (I think we talked about a couple of these examples.)
  2) Start with a simple “print value” node.
  3) Add a “filter when name = sys.uptime” node and add a trigger when that is < 1800.
