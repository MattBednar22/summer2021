## Summer 2021:

Hello and welcome! This is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a
README with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues. Please
create a folder named per your lastname. If you need to create documents, spreadsheets
and share them, feel free to create a folder named per your lastname in our shared [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1njZeZ_OMHzq_Boqq-nnEhC31kd1-coqr)
and link to your GitHub files.

[Here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2018/tree/master/morrison) is an
example of a student space organization. Please follow it in organizing your
space.
