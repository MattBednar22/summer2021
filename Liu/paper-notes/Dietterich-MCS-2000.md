### Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning

Author: Thomas G. Dietterich

 - Ensemble methods are learning algorithms that construct a set of classifiers and then classify new data points by taking a (weigh- ted) vote of their predictions. 
 - The original ensemble method is Bayesian averaging, but more recent algorithms include error-correcting output coding, Bagging, and boosting. 
 - This paper reviews these methods and explains why ensembles can often perform better than any single classi- fier. Some previous studies comparing ensemble methods are reviewed, and some new experiments are presented to uncover the reasons that Adaboost does not overfit rapidly.
