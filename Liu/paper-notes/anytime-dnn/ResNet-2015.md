## Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

Authors: Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun

### ResNet
 - We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. 
 - We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. 
 - We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth.
