### Distributed Deep Neural Networks (DDNNs)
 - distributed computing hierarchies, consisting of the cloud, the edge (fog) and geographically distributed end devices. 
 - map sections of a single DNN onto a distributed computing hierarchy and jointly training these sections, 
 - a DDNN allows fast and localized inference using some shallow portions of the DNN at the edge and end devices. 
 - via distributed computing, DDNNs naturally enhance sensor fusion, data privacy and system fault tolerance for DNN applications
 - When supported by a scalable distributed computing hierarchy, a DDNN can scale up in neural network size and scale out in geographical span.
